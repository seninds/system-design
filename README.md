# System Design

This repository is a collection of knowledge how to design scalable and robust systems.

## Goals

1. To collect possible directions of exploration for certain design problems.
1. To specify the most interesting cases in these problems for further quantitative, component and trade-off analysis.
1. To provide examples of implementation for specified design problem use cases.
1. To select and identify reusable modules between different design implementations.
1. To collect links for relevant papers about designing systems and their parts.
